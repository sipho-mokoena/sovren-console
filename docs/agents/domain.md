# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout: single-context

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/
│   ├── specs/sovren-control-plane.md   ← authoritative on behaviour
│   └── tech-stack.md                   ← requirements R1–R69 + stack decisions
└── packages/
```

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the domain vocabulary.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- **`docs/specs/sovren-control-plane.md`** — authoritative on behaviour. If a change contradicts it, that is a spec change, not a free choice.
- **`docs/tech-stack.md`** — indexes requirements `R1`–`R69` and the stack decisions. Cite the `R` number a piece of work serves.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids — see `docs/tech-stack.md` R22–R28, which record where upstream nouns are adopted verbatim and where sovren's own names were coined.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
